# Purpose
Provides a dashboard of weather observations across the globe at a single point in time.  Four metrics are plotted that include cloudiness, humidity, temperature and wind speed on 10/08/2019. Each metric is plotted against latitude looking for patterns.  Source data is provided in a table and the data sources tab provides a description of the approach to guarantee the entire globe was covered (and limitations).  Bootstrap is used for formatting and for enabling auto resizing based on browser sizing.
